# Finger-Controlled Screen Cursor 🎯🖐️

Control your computer's **mouse cursor, click**, and even **scroll** — just by using hand gestures in the air!
Built using **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, **Autopy**, and **PyAutoGUI** libraries, this project leverages computer vision to offer a touchless interface using finger tracking.

## ✨ Features/Instructions

* **Move Cursor**: Raise your index finger and thumb to move the cursor on screen.
* **Click**: Bring thumb and index finger together for a click action.
* **Scroll**: Raise both index and middle fingers and move them on top of each other to scroll.
